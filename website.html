        <h2>Favorite Websites</h2>
        <div>
            <p>I enjoy watching animes and Korean tv shows. I have some favorite websites through which I watch these.
                Some of them are Gogoanime and Kissanime. These are free websites and work pretty well.</p>
            <p>
                Another website I enjoy going through is that of the Kerala tourism official website. A reason I like it
                is that its done well and looks amazing.
                You can click <a href="https://www.keralatourism.org/" target="_blank">here</a> and experience it
                yourself.

                Reddit,Pandora,Wikileaks,eBay,Youtube,etc.Among these the most used by me is of course the <a
