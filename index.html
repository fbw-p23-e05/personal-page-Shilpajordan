        <div>
            <p>I enjoy watching animes and Korean tv shows. I have some favorite websites through which I watch these.
                Some of them are Gogoanime and Kissanime. These are free websites and work pretty well.</p>
            <p>
                Another website I enjoy going through is that of the Kerala tourism official website. A reason I like it
                is that its done well and looks amazing.

        <h2>Favorite Travel Destinations</h2>
        <div>
            <p>These are some of my favorite travel destinations.
            <ol>
                <li>Bamberg</li>
                <img src="img/Bamberg.jpeg" width="50%" alt="Bamberg" srcset="">
                <p>Bamberg is a town in northern Bavaria, Germany, laid out over 7 hills where the Regnitz and Main
                    rivers
                    meet. Its old town preserves structures from the 11th to 19th centuries including the muraled Altes
                    Rathaus (town hall), which occupies an island in the Regnitz reached by arched bridges. </p>
                <li>Maldives</li>
                <img src="img/Maldives.jpeg" width="50%" alt="Maldives">
                <p>
                    The Maldives, officially the Republic of Maldives, is an archipelagic state and country in South
                    Asia,
                    situated in the Indian Ocean. It lies southwest of Sri Lanka and India, about 750 kilometres from
                    the
                    Asian continent's mainland.
                </p>
                <li>Muscat</li>
                <img src="img/Muscat.jpeg" width="50%" alt="Muscat">

                <p>Muscat, Omanâ€™s port capital, sits on the Gulf of Oman surrounded by mountains and desert. With
                    history dating back to antiquity, it mixes high-rises and upscale shopping malls with clifftop
                    landmarks such as the 16th-century Portuguese forts, Al Jalali and Mirani, looming over Muscat
                    Harbor. Its modern, marble-clad Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque, with 50m dome and prodigious Persian
                    carpet, can accommodate 20,000 people. </p>
